### Initial steps ###
## In the terminal type python setup.py install to install the above packages to the path
## Do this in the virtual environment to keep it isolated and clean
## Do python setup.py develop to update the packages
## Remember geckodriver for Firefox is a pain. Might have to install it and update your system PATH
## For elements, I have stuck them in a dictionary within the main project area
## Project areas can be considered feature areas too
## Create an environment.py file and put it in the root of where you will run behave. This will have setup and teardown functions
## Also create a browser class to get ready to create page objects too
